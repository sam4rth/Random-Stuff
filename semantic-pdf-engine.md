## 🧠 Final Project Breakdown – Adobe Hackathon (Round 3)
Context:  
We are building a complete **semantic document explorer system**. The backend handles PDF analysis and semantic linking. The frontend provides a UI for exploring relationships between concepts. This is the full breakdown of what we’re building and how each part fits together. This guide will help us track progress, assign work, and understand the full flow.

### 🥇 STEP 1: PDF Extraction Pipeline

#### 🔍 Goal:
Extract raw text and basic layout from the uploaded PDF.

#### 🔧 Tools:
- PyMuPDF (`fitz`)
- or `pdfminer.six`

#### ✅ What to do:
- Loop through PDF pages
- Extract page number, text, and maybe headings
- Store output like:

```json
[
  { "page": 1, "text": "Introduction to ML..." },
  { "page": 2, "text": "Neural Networks are..." }
]
```

---

### 🥈 STEP 2: Chunking the Text

#### 🔍 Goal:
Split extracted text into meaningful units (chunks).

#### 🔧 Tools:
- Python split
- or `nltk` for sentence tokenization

#### ✅ What to do:
- Split by paragraph or heading
- Filter chunks that are too short or irrelevant
- Output:

```json
[
  { "chunk_id": 1, "text": "ML is a field of AI..." },
  { "chunk_id": 2, "text": "Supervised learning is..." }
]
```

---

### 🥉 STEP 3: Create Semantic Embeddings

#### 🔍 Goal:
Convert chunks to vectors that represent meaning.

#### 🔧 Tools:
- `sentence-transformers` with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

#### ✅ What to do:
- Use pre-trained BERT model
- Create vector for each chunk
- Store vectors with chunk IDs

---

### 🏗️ STEP 4: Semantic Linking (Chunk Relationships)

#### 🔍 Goal:
Find semantically similar chunks using vector math.

#### 🔧 Tools:
- `sklearn` cosine similarity
- or `faiss` for fast search

#### ✅ What to do:
- For each chunk, find top-k similar ones
- Store relationships:

```json
{
  "chunk_id": 12,
  "related": [15, 18, 5, 3, 9]
}
```

---

### 🧪 STEP 5: Expose APIs

#### 🔍 Goal:
Make the backend usable by the frontend.

#### 🔧 Tools:
- `FastAPI` or `Flask`

#### ✅ What to build:
- `/upload_pdf`: Accepts and processes a PDF
- `/related_chunks?chunk_id=...`: Return semantically linked chunks
- `/search?query=...`: Semantic search over all chunks
- `/semantic_map?doc_id=...`: Return map of related chunks

---

### 🗂️ STEP 6: Store and Serve the Data

#### 🔍 Goal:
Persist the information for re-use

#### 🔧 Tools:
- SQLite / PostgreSQL
- or simple JSON files

#### ✅ What to do:
- Save PDF metadata, chunks, embeddings, links
- Organize files by doc_id

---

### 🖼️ STEP 7: Build Flutter Frontend

#### 🔍 Goal:
Create interactive UI to explore documents

#### 🔧 Tools:
- Flutter with Dio (for API calls)
- PDF preview packages

#### ✅ Features:
- Upload a PDF
- View extracted chunks
- Click on a chunk → show related chunks
- Search bar → semantic search
- Optionally: semantic map visualization

---

### 🧠 STEP 8: Add Intelligence Layer (Optional)

#### ✅ Features:
- Chunk summaries
- “Why are these related?” explanations
- Named entity recognition (NER)
- User feedback logging

---

### 📦 STEP 9: Final Submission & Docs

#### ✅ To-do:
- Write README
- Add comments to code
- Prepare video demo (optional)
- Submit on Adobe portal

## 👇 Recap Table

| Stage          | What It Does                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| PDF Parsing    | Extracts raw text and structure           |
| Chunking       | Splits into manageable units              |
| Embedding      | Converts text into semantic vectors       |
| Linking        | Finds related chunks                      |
| API            | Exposes all data for frontend             |
| Storage        | Saves structured info                     |
| Frontend       | UI to explore and query documents         |
| Intelligence   | Optional layer for insight/summaries      |

### 🧠 Final Analogy:

You are building a **semantic brain for documents**.  
It will:
- Read PDFs like a human
- Understand how ideas relate
- Serve that intelligence to a beautiful frontend
