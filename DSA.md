Great question — the **first round** is your **gateway** to the rest of the hackathon. It's a **filtering round** based on **algorithms, data structures**, and **basic problem-solving skills** — no AI, no Flutter, just sharp DSA thinking.

## 🎯 First Round Overview

| Part   | Details                                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MCQ    | 15 Questions – focus on logic, time complexity, output prediction |
| Coding | 1 full coding problem – similar to Leetcode medium                |

Your **team average** matters, so **all 3 members must prep properly**.

## 🛠️ What to Prepare: 3 Pillars

### 1. 📘 **Data Structures & Algorithms**

Focus on:

* Arrays & Strings
* Hashmaps/Sets
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Stack, Queue, LinkedList basics
* Binary Search
* Sorting (esp. custom comparator)
* Prefix Sum & Sliding Window
* Greedy logic
* Time & Space complexity

👉 **Resources:**

* Striver's DSA Sheet: [https://takeuforward.org](https://takeuforward.org)
* Neetcode 150
* Leetcode: Easy → Medium

---

### 2. 🤔 **Logic-Based MCQs**

Expect:

* Code snippets → What is output?
* Find Time Complexity
* Bug spotting
* Algorithm behavior (e.g., “what happens in this BFS step?”)

👉 **Practice:**

* GFG Quiz section
* Leetcode “Explore Cards”
* CS50 problem sets (basic logic ones)

---

### 3. 👨‍💻 **Coding Problem Practice**

Expect 1 moderate coding question like:

* String pattern matching
* Simulated logic (chessboard, grid)
* Map-based frequency handling
* Sliding window optimization
* Sorting with conditions

👉 **Practice this way:**

* Set 60 min timer
* Use \[Hackerrank], \[Codestudio], \[Leetcode]
* Do 2–3 mock contests

---

## 🧪 Mock Test Strategy

Simulate this once per week:

* 30 min → 15 MCQs (practice from GFG quiz, or take any random coding MCQ challenge)
* 60 min → 1 Leetcode medium problem

## ✅ How to Divide Prep in Team

| Week   | Action                                                   |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | Each member picks 2 DSA topics & prepares + shares notes |
| Week 2 | Solve 10 MCQs/day + 1 coding Q every 2 days              |
| Week 3 | Do 2 timed mock tests together on Google Meet            |
| Week 4 | Final revision + group problem-solving sessions          |

---

## 🧠 Smart Tips

* Prepare **handwritten cheat sheets** for time complexity, edge cases
* Revise **input/output format** handling (especially in C++/Python)
* Practice **fast debugging** under time pressure
* Don’t panic if 1–2 MCQs are confusing — accuracy > guesswork

---

## 📦 Final Checklist Before Round

✅ Basic I/O
✅ Strings, Arrays, Maps
✅ Recursion
✅ MCQ logic practice
✅ 3–5 full coding questions solved
✅ Google Meet mock test (solo + team average)
